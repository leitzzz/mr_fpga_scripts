# mr_fpga_scripts

This repo is intended to make easy start to use the Mister FPGA, and get the neccesary scripts to start to use this device and play NES, Snes, NeoGeo and some others.

I assume that you have an active internet connection to this scripts download all the required files to start to play with the Mister FPGA.

The way that you can use this is, for example go to the folder snes_setup/ and copy this file to your "Scripts" folder and later with the micro SD inserted in the Mister FPGA, run the script "snes_setup.sh" and will start to download from internet all the neccessary files.
