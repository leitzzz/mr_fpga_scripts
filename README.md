# mr_fpga_scripts

This repo is intended to make easy start to use the Mister FPGA, and get the neccesary scripts to start to use this device and play NES, Snes, NeoGeo and some others.

I assume that you have an active internet connection to this scripts download all the required files to start to play with the Mister FPGA.

In the folder releases are the current versions that i have released, check for example the folder "releases/1.0.0/" an inside of this folder you will find the files neccessary to copy into "Scripts" folder of the SD card in the Mister FPGA.

Later with the Micro SD inserted in the Mister FPGA, go to the "Scripts" menu on the Mister FPGA and run for example "snes_setup" and will start to download the requirred files to let you start to play SNES games; the same applies with the other Script files.
